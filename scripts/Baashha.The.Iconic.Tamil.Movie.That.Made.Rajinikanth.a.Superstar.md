The film was inspired by a scene from Rajinikanth's Hindi film Hum (1991), where he reveals his true identity as a gangster to his family. Suresh Krissna adapted the scene along with the core plot and key elements of Hum to create Baashha. The film was produced by R. M. Veerappan under his banner Sathya Movies, with music composed by Deva and cinematography by P. S. Prakash.
 
Baashha was released on 12 January 1995 and received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The film became one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of all time and ran for nearly 15 months in theatres. Rajinikanth's performance as Baashha was widely praised and earned him several awards, including the Filmfans Association Award and the Cinema Express Award for Best Actor. The film's dialogues, songs, and scenes became cult classics and are often quoted by fans and celebrities.
 
Baashha was remade in Kannada as Kotigobba (2001) starring Vishnuvardhan. A digitally restored version of the film was released on 3 March 2017 to mark its 22nd anniversary. Baashha is considered to be one of the best films of Rajinikanth and one of the most influential films in Tamil cinema history.

Baashha is also known for its memorable dialogues, such as "Naan oru thadava sonna, nooru thadava sonna madhiri" ("If I say something once, it's as though I've said it a hundred times"), which became a catchphrase among Rajinikanth's fans. The film also features some iconic scenes, such as the interval block where Manickam reveals his true identity as Baashha to Antony, and the climax fight where Baashha confronts Antony in a hospital. The film's songs, composed by Deva, were also well-received and became chartbusters. The song "Azhagu" was adapted from the Hindi song "Dilbar Dil Se Pyare" from the film Caravan (1971), composed by R. D. Burman.
 
Baashha was a trendsetter in Tamil cinema and established Rajinikanth as a mass hero. The film influenced many subsequent films that featured heroes with a hidden past or a dual identity. The film also inspired many parodies and references in various media. The film's popularity led to several re-releases in different formats and languages over the years. In 2012, a Hindi dubbed version titled Manik Baashha was released by Bhadrakali Films, with a new opening credits score by Deva. In 2017, a digitally restored version of the film was released in Tamil Nadu and overseas markets, with improved sound and picture quality.
 
Baashha is widely regarded as one of the best films of Rajinikanth and one of the most influential films in Tamil cinema history. The film has been praised for its screenplay, direction, performances, music, dialogues, and action sequences. The film has also been appreciated for its social message of non-violence and forgiveness. The film has been studied and analysed by various scholars and critics for its cultural and cinematic impact. The film has also been selected for preservation in the National Film Archive of India.

However, the Aerosoft CRJ 700/900 X add-on is not free. You have to pay around $50 to get it from the official Aerosoft website or other online stores. But what if you want to try it out without spending any money? Is there a way to get it for free?
 
The answer is yes, but it is not legal or recommended. Some people have managed to crack the add-on and share it online for others to download. This is a violation of the intellectual property rights of Aerosoft and the developers of the add-on. It also poses a risk of malware infection, corrupted files, compatibility issues and poor performance.
 
If you still want to take the risk and install the cracked version of Aerosoft CRJ 700/900 X, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Download the cracked version of Aerosoft CRJ 700/900 X from a torrent site or a file-sharing platform. One possible source is this YouTube video[^2^] that claims to provide a link to the cracked version in its description. However, be careful as this link might be fake or harmful.
2. Extract the downloaded file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should get a folder named "Aerosoft\_CRJ\_700-900-X\_FSX-P3D".
3. Copy this folder and paste it into your main simulator folder. For example, if you are using FSX Steam Edition, your main simulator folder should be something like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FSX".
4. Run your simulator and select one of the CRJ models from the aircraft selection menu. You should be able to fly them without any activation or registration.

Congratulations, you have successfully installed Aerosoft CRJ 700/900 X for free. However, keep in mind that this is an illegal and unethical way of getting the add-on. You are depriving Aerosoft and the developers of their deserved income and support. You are also exposing yourself to potential legal consequences, malware attacks and technical problems.
 
The best way to enjoy Aerosoft CRJ 700/900 X is to buy it from the official Aerosoft website[^1^] or other authorized sellers. You will get a legitimate copy of the add-on that is updated, supported and compatible with your simulator. You will also show your appreciation and respect for the hard work and creativity of Aerosoft and the developers.
